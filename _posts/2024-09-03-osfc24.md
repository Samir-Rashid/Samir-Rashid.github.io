## Provable Security in Embedded Systems: Verification Work in Tock OS

> [Tock OS](https://tockos.org/) secures millions of devices and uses language, architectural, and formal techniques to statically enforce system guarantees. This talk will go over how the Tock operating system eliminates many bugs that plague other OSes at compile time. I will demonstrate how we are mitigating logic bugs in Tock OS by using lightweight formal verification ([Flux](https://github.com/flux-rs/flux)).

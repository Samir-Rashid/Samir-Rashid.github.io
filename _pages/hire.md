I am actively interested in new positions at this time. I am interested in work where I can work on formal verification and/or systems software (Operating Systems, Low-Level, or Performance) and prefer to be able to open source my work. Please check my [resume](https://godsped.com/cv) for links to my past experiences.
<!-- update alongside about.md -->

## Portfolio
My main projects can be found on my [resume](https://godsped.com/cv). Other things can be found on my [GitHub](https://github.com/Samir-Rashid).

## Philanthropy
If you have an old computer, I help refurbish and donate computers.

## Want to work with me?
Contact me through my information in the sidebar. Email is best. You can also email `me at this domain`.
